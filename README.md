Product requirement document (PRD)
-	Software title
U值计算器

-	Background and motivation of this 
The U value is quite essential for Architectural Environment Engineers measure thermal conductivity.it is convenient to have a software than can help solve U value automatically.

-	Key functions of the software
The key function is calculating the U value of the wall, windows and other structures in the building.


	Algorithm/scientific methods behind your software 
This software use tkinter in python3 as a tool. The equation in PCM class was used. The user types the thickness of the wall and the thermal conductivity, and then can get the U value.
 
U=1/Rt
Rt=Rt = Rsi + R1 + R2 + R3 + ...+ Rn + Rse
R = D / λ
